This repo contains the code I developed during the bachelor’s end of degree project I worked on to finish the Bachelor’s Degree in Aerospace Engineering at the Technical University of Madrid. The summary of the paper is presented below, and the full paper is available from [Github](https://github.com/sesiga/sesiga.github.io/raw/master/papers/TransferenciaDeformacionesMallasCFD.pdf). This project has been developed in Spanish.

The process of generating good quality cfd meshes is time demanding and they are specifically design to be used by cfd software. If the surface of an object is modified, the mesh can be created again with the new surface specification. Since this process may require a lot of time, specially if someone needs to simulate many surface deformations, we could try other approaches as deformating all the mesh but matching the original deformation of the surface.
In this project, we focus on the motion of 2D arifoils given the original mesh (containing the airfoil) and the deformation of the surface. The goal is to create a new mesh where all the nodes of the original mesh are deformed accordingly to the deformation of the surface.
