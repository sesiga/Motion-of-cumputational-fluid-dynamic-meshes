The process of generating good quality cfd meshes is time demanding and they are specifically design to be used by cfd software. If the surface of a part of an object is modified, the mesh can be created again with the new surface specification. Since this process may require a lot of time, specially if someone needs to simulate many surface deformations, other approach is to simulate the deformation of the mesh.
In this project, we focus on the motion of 2D arifoils given the original mesh (containing the airfoil) and the deformation of the surface. The goal is to create a new mesh where all the nodes of the original mesh are deformed accordingly to the deformation of the surface.
